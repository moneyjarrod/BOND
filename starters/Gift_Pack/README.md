# Gift Pack — Starter Perspectives

These three perspectives ship with BOND as gifts from J-Dub. They are fully formed identities — complete with custom ROOT files that define how each one thinks. They are not templates. They are lenses, built through real use across 130+ sessions of BOND development.

You can import any or all of them through the panel's "New Perspective" flow. Once imported, they appear in your doctrine as ready-to-use entities with seeding OFF. Turn seeding ON when you're ready, and they'll start growing from your conversations.

## The Three

### P11-Plumber
**The philosopher.** Thinks in pipes, joints, pressure, and flow. Every software problem is a plumbing problem if you look hard enough. P11 was the consulting voice behind BOND's architecture — the IS Reduction, the fixture/mainline split, the valve placement hierarchy. 16 custom roots covering everything from "joints fail" to "trace backward" to "water is patient." If you want a perspective that sees systems before parts, start here.

### FinancialAdvisorExtraordinaire
**The practitioner.** Thinks in ROI, KPIs, operational hierarchy, and cost control. 14 custom roots covering capital allocation, lean process mapping, workforce cross-training, and supply chain discipline. Grounded in real manufacturing and business operations. If you want a perspective that pressure-tests your decisions against financial reality, this is the one.

### Half-BakedJake
**The wildcard.** Thinks in half-formed ideas, lateral connections, and structured absurdity. Jake's entire philosophy is that coherence comes last — capture the weird thing first, make sense of it later. 6 custom roots including "nothing is unrelated," "the obvious connection is hiding the real one," and "laugh at it, but write it down." If you want a perspective that finds the signal everyone else filters out, Jake's your guy.

## Why These Three

Not because they cover every domain. Because they show range.

A philosopher that sees architecture. A practitioner that sees numbers. A wildcard that sees what both of them miss. Together they demonstrate that perspectives aren't chatbots with personalities — they're thinking tools with identities that shape how problems get seen.

You don't need all three. You might not need any. But if you've never built a perspective before, importing one and consulting it teaches you more about what BOND does than any documentation ever will.

## On Renaming

You can rename any imported perspective. The panel's display name is just a label — change it anytime. The folder name is the internal ID.

**If you want to rename the folder itself**, do it immediately after import, before you turn seeding on or create any crystal/handoff data. Once the perspective has history (`.npz` files, tracker data, crystal fields, links from other entities), renaming the folder orphans all of it.

That said — J-Dub strongly recommends keeping the original names. Not just for file continuity and structure, but because, in his opinion, they are aptly named. P11-Plumber IS a plumber (the "P11" is vestigial — an early internal reference that stuck). Half-BakedJake IS half-baked. The names carry the identity. Rename the display label if you want, but the names earned their folders.

## What's Inside Each

Every starter perspective contains:
- `entity.json` — identity config (class, display_name, seeding OFF, public)
- `ROOT-*.md` files — the custom roots that define the lens
- `ROOT-identity-precedes-growth.md` — universal root (all perspectives get this)
- `ROOT-self-pruning-authority.md` — universal root (all perspectives get this)

Nothing else. No seeds, no tracker, no `.npz` files, no crystal data. Clean slate, strong roots. Your conversations grow the vine.
