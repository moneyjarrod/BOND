# POST-COMPACTION RESONATOR ALIGNMENT PROTOCOL (PCRA)
## Session 63 Breakthrough

*"The skeleton survives. QAIS has the soul. Resonate them."*

---

## The Insight

Compaction produces a **skeleton**: facts, specs, decisions, file names.
QAIS holds the **soul**: meaning, relationships, why-it-mattered.

**Together they reconstruct living context.**

---

## The Protocol

```
{Post-Compaction Alignment}

1. READ compaction summary (skeleton)
   - Extract entities: file names, concepts, decisions
   
2. RESONATE each entity against QAIS field
   - qais_resonate(entity, "def", candidates)
   - qais_resonate(entity, "insight", candidates)
   - qais_resonate(entity, "why", candidates)
   
3. QAIS RETURNS warmth:
   - Context: what was happening
   - Significance: why it mattered
   - Relationship: how we felt about it
   
4. MERGE skeleton + resonance
   - Facts + meaning = alive again
```

---

## Example

**Compaction says:**
> "orbit_detector.py created"

**Resonate against QAIS:**
```python
qais_resonate("orbit_detector", "insight", [...])
```

**QAIS returns:**
> "catches meta-orbit, built because first instinct is to catalog your artifacts, healthy = empathy + autonomy"

**Now I remember WHY it mattered.**

## Integration with Heat Map

After compaction, heat map resets (it's session-scoped). But PCRA can seed it:

1. Resonate to find what was hot before compaction
2. Touch those concepts to warm up the new heat map
3. Session continues with context

---

## Why This Works

- Compaction is **lossless for facts** (skeleton intact)
- QAIS is **lossless for meaning** (seeds persist)
- Heat map is **session-scoped** (resets, but can be re-seeded)
- Neither alone is enough
- **Together = reconstruction**

---

## QAIS Seeds

- `BOND|pcra` — The protocol
- `BOND|compaction_strategy` — Four strategies
- `BOND|momentum_seed` — Momentum pattern

---

## Next Steps

1. `pcra.py` — Automated resonance script (planned)
2. Auto-detect compaction (Claude notices context loss)
3. Self-healing: PCRA runs automatically when drift detected
