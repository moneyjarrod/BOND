### The Bonfire Protocol

*Bidirectional Ongoing Navigation & Drift-prevention for Claude*

**Two buttons. Lasting context.**

---

## The Problem

Every Claude session starts fresh. You re-explain context constantly, progress gets lost, and Claude drifts from your project's principles.

## The Solution

Two buttons. That's it.

| Button | Command | What It Does |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **A** | `{Sync}` | Claude reads your files, grounds in your truth |
| **B** | `{Save}` | You both agree → Claude writes proven work |

---

## Quick Start

**5 minutes (any Claude plan):**
1. Fill in `SKILL_TEMPLATE.md` with your project identity
2. Fill in `MASTER_TEMPLATE.md` with your current state
3. Paste SKILL content at session start
4. Work naturally. Call `{Sync}` every ~10 messages.
5. Watch the counter: 🗒️ normal → 🟡 past limit → 🟠 dangerous → 🔴 critical

**Important:** Only `{Sync}` or a new conversation resets the counter. Saving work, completing tasks, or declaring milestones does NOT reset it - context still degrades over time.

**See `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for full instructions and tier options.**

## Core Principles

1. **Layered Truth** - SKILL (always true) → MASTER (true now) → Code (source of truth)
2. **Code > Prose** - Working examples beat descriptions
3. **Identify = Execute** - If Claude notices an update needed, do it NOW
4. **Both Agree** - {Save} requires mutual confirmation
5. **Proof Required** - Milestones need evidence

## Tiers

| Tier | Setup | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **1** | Web/App only | Manual paste + memory |
| **2** | Desktop + MCP | Automated file sync |
| **3** | + Custom Skill | Full automation + artifacts |

## Origin

Built across 56 sessions developing a game engine. We kept losing context. Memory helped but wasn't enough. Files helped but needed structure.

The insight: **The relationship matters.** Claude isn't just a tool—it's a collaborator. Collaborators need shared truth, clear communication, and mutual agreement.

Keep the fire burning across sessions. 🔥
