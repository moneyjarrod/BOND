## Constraints (Protect the Cleanliness)

1. **Do not add more axes casually** — G and P are proven. Don't bolt on a third axis without the same rigor.
2. **Do not overfit projection training** — 79 sentences, frozen forever. That's the point.
3. **Do not reintroduce vocab logic "just in case"** — JA/JA+ is dead. Gap = field imbalance, not vocabulary scan.
4. **Do not rush to operational complexity** — ISS is clean right now. Protect that.

## Legitimate Future Directions (when ready)

Named landscape — none required to call B66 done:

- **Temporal dynamics** — How G/P balance shifts across sequences
- **Multi-span composition** — How forces combine across paragraphs or docs
- **QAIS-side analytics** — Field-level imbalance trends over time
- **Cross-agent alignment** — Compare ISS fields between agents (spicy)
