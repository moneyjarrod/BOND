SUMMARY:
BOND Counter v5: User-side turn tracking with auto-reset

DESCRIPTION:
Complete solution for reliable turn counting in Claude conversations.

## Problem Solved
Claude's internal counter failed due to:
- Tool chain context displacement (S70a)
- Limit boundary pattern interference (S70b)
- Multi-emission during tool chains (S70c)

## Solution
User-side tracking via AutoHotkey:
- Script appends «tN» to messages automatically
- Claude reads tag, no internal counting
- Auto-resets on {Sync} or {Full Restore}

## Features
- Enter key auto-tags when Claude window active
- Toggle ON/OFF with Ctrl+Shift+B
- Auto-reset detects {Sync}/{Full Restore} as you type
- Persists N across restarts
- Works with Claude Desktop AND browser

## Files
- BOND_counter_v5.ahk — The script
- BOND_COUNTER_README.md — Full documentation

## Key Insight
"User = source of truth. Claude just reads the tag."

Counter failures become architecturally impossible.
