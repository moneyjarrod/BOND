## Layer Hierarchy

```
     CODE / WORKING EXAMPLES     ← SOURCE OF TRUTH
              │
              │ overrides
              ▼
           MASTER                ← CURRENT STATE
              │
              │ overrides
              ▼
           SKILL                 ← ALWAYS TRUE
```

## Cross-Instance Flow (The BOND)

```
SESSION 1: Work → Bonfire 🔥 → {Save} → MASTER + Memory updated
                    │
                    ▼
         [Session ends, Claude instance terminates]
                    │
        Memory persists ✓   MASTER persists ✓   SKILL persists ✓
                    │
                    ▼
         [New session, new Claude instance]
                    │
                    ▼
SESSION 2: {Sync} → Claude reads files → BOND restored → Work continues
```

## Drift and Recovery (The D in BOND)

```
NORMAL OPERATION
       │
       ▼ (long conversation without sync)
       │
    DRIFT OCCURS
       │
       ├─ QUICK: Say a mantra
       ├─ MEDIUM: {Sync}
       └─ FULL: Paste SKILL + "Reset"
       │
       ▼
ALIGNMENT RESTORED
```

## BOND Acronym

```
B - Bidirectional    → Both parties agree before writing
O - Ongoing          → Continuous across sessions  
N - Navigation       → Layered truth guides decisions
D - Drift-prevention → Regular sync catches drift early
```
