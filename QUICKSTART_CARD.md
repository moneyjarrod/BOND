## THE TWO BUTTONS

| | Command | When | Action |
|-|---------|------|--------|
| **A** | `{Sync}` | Every ~10 msgs | Read files, reset counter |
| **B** | `{Save}` | Work proven | Both agree → write |

---

## SESSION START

**Tier 1:** Paste SKILL → "Continuing [PROJECT]..."
**Tier 2:** `[PROJECT] work. {Sync}`
**Tier 3:** `[PROJECT] work. {Sync} then {ArtD}`

---

## COUNTER STATES

**Counter on EVERY response. No exceptions.**

| State | Display | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Normal | `🗒️ N/LIMIT` | Keep working |
| Past Limit | `🟡 N/LIMIT` | Consider sync |
| Dangerous | `🟠 N/LIMIT` | Sync soon (15+) |
| Critical | `🔴 N/LIMIT` | Sync NOW (20+) |

Yellow = past YOUR limit. Orange/Red = universal.
