## 2. CORE TRUTH

```
VOICE
  Third person limited, past tense
  Lyrical but not purple
  Short paragraphs, dialogue drives scenes

CHARACTERS
  Elena (protagonist) - guarded, observant, dry humor
  Marcus - charismatic but untrustworthy
  The Garden - treated as character, not setting

DRAFT STATES
  Rough → Revised → Polished → Final
```

---

## 3. MANTRAS

```
"Show the garden, not the gardener's intent."
"Elena notices details others miss."
"If a scene doesn't change something, cut it."
"Trust the reader."
```

---

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS (NEVER)

- Head-hopping (stay in Elena's POV)
- Adverb dialogue tags
- Starting chapters with weather
- Passive voice in action scenes
