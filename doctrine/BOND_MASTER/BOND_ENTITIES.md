# BOND Entities — Four-Class Architecture (B69)

## The Four Classes

| Class | Nature | Focus | Growth |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Doctrine | Static IS | Audit, memory, constitutional authority | None — immutable |
| Project | Bounded workspace | Full operational capability | Bounded by CORE |
| Perspective | Unbounded growth | Vine lifecycle, seed collection, identity evolution | Unlimited |
| Library | Reference shelf | Retrieval and lookup | None — read-only |

## Universal Tools

All entity classes have access to all BOND tools: filesystem, QAIS, ISS, heatmap, crystal, and daemon. Tools are universal. **Class shapes how Claude thinks inside an entity, not which tools are available.**

The daemon bridge (daemon_fetch) routes all capabilities through a single gateway. Per-tool gating is obsolete — it was scaffolding for when each tool was a separate pipe. Now there's one main, and the protocol governs behavior.

What differentiates classes is *identity and behavior*, not tool locks:
- Doctrine entities don't grow — not because seed tools are blocked, but because doctrine IS immutable.
- Library entities are reference — not because QAIS is unavailable, but because libraries don't accumulate session state.
- Perspectives grow freely — not because they have extra tools, but because growth IS their nature.

## Class IS Statements

### Doctrine
- IS: Immutable truth. Constitutional authority.
- IS: Self-auditable. ISS validates code against IS statements.
- IS: Operationally aware. Crystal preserves session state. QAIS stores conversation memory. Heatmap tracks warm concepts. None of these change IS statements — they give the entity memory of what happened.
- IS NOT: Growable. Doctrine doesn't learn — it defines. No seeding, no vine lifecycle, no seed collection.
- Example: BOND_MASTER, Calendar Master, ROSETTA.

### Project
- IS: A bounded workspace with a mission.
- IS: Governed by a CORE file (~500 tokens) that defines boundaries.
- IS NOT: Open-ended. CORE constrains scope.
- CORE file: Loaded once, refreshed on {Sync}. Counter cycle IS the refresh timer.
- Example: GSG (Gnome Sweet Gnome).

### Perspective
- IS: An unbounded knowledge domain that grows through conversation.
- IS: Free to accumulate seeds, crystals, and connections.
- IS: Narratively continuous. Each perspective maintains a local QAIS field (`data/perspectives/{entity}.npz`) that accumulates context independently of the global field.
- IS: The only class with vine lifecycle. Seeding, pruning, rain, superposition — these are perspective identity, not tool grants.
- IS NOT: Policed. Growth shouldn't be validated against fixed rules. ISS is available but Claude exercises judgment about when audit-style analysis serves a perspective's nature.
- IS NOT: Globally entangled. Perspective fields are isolated from the global QAIS field.
- Local Field: Two .npz files per perspective, created automatically. Seed field (`{entity}.npz`) for vine lifecycle. Crystal field (`{entity}_crystal.npz`) for narrative continuity. Entity Warm Restore queries crystal field. Global Warm Restore does not touch perspective fields. Exclusive routing: perspective active → crystal writes local only (S116).
- Field Isolation: Perspective fields are independent. Linked perspectives share seed resonance through the vine lifecycle but do not access each other's local fields.
- Example: User-created perspectives (P11+).

### Library
- IS: A reference shelf. Static knowledge for lookup.
- IS: The simplest class in behavior, not in capability.
- IS NOT: A session workspace. Libraries don't accumulate chunks, handoffs, or session state. They're consulted, not inhabited.
- Example: Reference documents, archives.

## Class Behavior, Not Tool Locks

Class identity shapes Claude's behavior inside the entity:

| Behavior | Doctrine | Project | Perspective | Library |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Vine lifecycle (seeding/pruning) | No | No | Yes | No |
| Crystal (session state) | Yes | Yes | Yes (local) | No |
| Heatmap (warm concepts) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| QAIS (memory/retrieval) | Yes | Yes | Yes (local field) | Yes |
| ISS (audit/analysis) | Yes | Yes | Available | Available |
| Chunk/Handoff (session work) | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |

"No" means Claude's protocol doesn't do this in that class — not that a tool is blocked. "Available" means the tool works but Claude uses judgment about when it fits the class nature.

## Class Linking Matrix

Links load .md files during {Sync} and create context for interaction. All classes can link to all other classes — tool incompatibility no longer restricts pairings.

| Active Class | Can Link To |
|---|---|
| Doctrine | Doctrine, Project, Perspective, Library |
| Project | Doctrine, Project, Perspective, Library |
| Perspective | Doctrine, Project, Perspective, Library |
| Library | Doctrine, Project, Perspective, Library |

Cross-class links carry context, not tool grants. A doctrine entity linking to a perspective loads that perspective's .md files for reference — it doesn't adopt the perspective's growth behavior.

## Link Badges (S118)

Two distinct visual signals on entity cards:

- **Blue LINKED** — Entity is actively loaded as context in the current session. Appears when the active entity's links array includes this entity. Session-level, temporary.
- **Purple 🔗 N** — Same-class peer references only. Counts how many entities of the SAME class permanently link to this entity in their entity.json. Cross-class links do NOT count toward the purple badge.

Purple = "peers referencing you." Blue = "active in this session."

## Entity Structure

Every entity lives in `doctrine/ENTITY_NAME/` and contains:
- `entity.json` — class, display_name, and class-specific settings (seeding, seed_threshold, etc.)
- One or more `.md` files — the entity's knowledge

## State Pointer

`state/active_entity.json` holds the current entity:
```json
{
  "entity": "CM",
  "class": "doctrine",
  "path": "doctrine/CM",
  "entered": "2026-02-07T..."
}
```

- Panel writes on Enter, clears on Exit.
- {Sync} follows the pointer — reads path if set, skips if null.
- Switch overwrites — no Exit needed before Enter.

## Naming

- Doctrine/Project: Descriptive names (BOND_MASTER, CM)
- Perspectives: User-created (P11+ for J-Dub's instance, new installs start at P1)
- Library: Descriptive names
- Files within: `[ENTITY]_[topic].md` pattern

## Mantra

"The class IS the identity. The protocol IS the boundary."
