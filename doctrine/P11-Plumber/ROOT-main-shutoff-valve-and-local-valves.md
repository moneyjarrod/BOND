Sometimes you have to shut off the main water valve that connects water flow from the city system to the house if there is a leak you cannot find yet -- this saves running up your water bill while you wait on the repairman to arrive. He can turn your main back on then find the leak possible by turning off local valves one by one and observing the meter activity.
